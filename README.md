# IPL Match Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the outcome of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
The model is trained on historical IPL data and predicts match results based on key features like team statistics, venue, toss decisions, and player performances.

## 🏏 Dataset
The dataset consists of IPL match records, including:
- Team names  
- Match venues  
- Toss winner & decision  
- Player performances  
- Match results (Win/Loss)

---

## 🔍 Model Approach
- **Preprocessing**: Data is preprocessed using a **ColumnTransformer** pipeline.  
- **Algorithm**: **Logistic Regression** with the **'liblinear' solver** is used.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Important features like team strength, toss impact, and match conditions are considered.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: 80%
  - **Log Loss**: Optimized to improve prediction reliability.

---

## 📊 Results
The model achieves an **80% accuracy** by fine‑tuning weights based on **log loss**, making it effective for predicting match outcomes.
